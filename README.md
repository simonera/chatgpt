# ChatGPT in Higher Education Survey
This repo includes materials related to a survey about the knowledge, use, and perceptions of ChatGPT and similar technologies in higher ed. I conducted the survey while working at Simmons University as Senior Research Analyst. 

Results from this survey will be presented at the 2024 AIR Forum, the annual conference of the Association for Institutional Research. The conference will be held in May 2024 in Denver, CO. A digital copy of the poster is [available here](https://github.com/simonera/chatgpt/blob/main/chatgpt_poster_40_by_40.pdf).
