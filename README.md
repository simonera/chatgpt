# ChatGPT in Higher Education Survey
This repository includes materials related to a survey about the knowledge, use, and perceptions of ChatGPT and similar technologies in higher ed. I conducted the survey while working at Simmons University as Senior Research Analyst together with Lan Gao, Executive Director of Institutional Research and Assessment. 

Data were collected in Fall 2023. Results from this survey were presented at the 2024 AIR Forum, the annual conference of the Association for Institutional Research, held in May 2024 in Denver, CO. A digital copy of the poster is [available here](https://github.com/simonera/chatgpt/blob/main/chatgpt_poster_40_by_40.pdf).
